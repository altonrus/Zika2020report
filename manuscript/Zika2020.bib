Z ika virus (ZIKV) was discovered in Africa in 1947 and was first detected in Asia in 1966, yet its potential effect on public health was not recognized until the virus caused outbreaks in the Pacific from 2007 to 2015 and began spreading throughout the Americas in 2015. 1,2 The ability of ZIKV to cause congenital defects in fetuses and infants, as exemplified by the microcephaly epidemic in Brazil, is an unprecedented feature in a mosquito-borne viral infection. 2-4 Although transmission of ZIKV has declined in the Americas, outbreaks and infection clusters continue to occur in some regions, such as India and Southeast Asia, where there are large populations of women of childbearing age who are susceptible to the virus. 5 We review the body of information that was acquired during the pandemic and discuss the epidemiologic trends, current knowledge about the transmission and natural history of ZIKV infection and its sequelae, and the principles of diagnosis and clinical management. Epidemiol ogic Fe at ur es ZIKV is a positive-sense RNA flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae, which also includes dengue (DENV), West Nile, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. 6 ZIKV was first isolated in 1947 in the Zika Forest in Uganda (Fig. 1), 7 where transmission of the ancestral African lineage of ZIKV was limited to enzootic circulation between nonhuman primates and sylvatic aedes mosquitoes, with sporadic spillover infection to humans. 2 As ZIKV migrated to Asia, the Asian lineage of the virus emerged (Fig. 2), which was capable of being transmitted by human-adapted aedes mosquitoes (e.g., Aedes aegypti). 1,2 Results of serologic and entomologic investigations suggest that ZIKV had an extensive geographic distribution in Africa and Asia before 2007. 1,9 However, fewer than 20 cases in humans were reported before 2007, and all had mild, self-limiting clinical manifestations. 1,2,10 The first indications of a change in the epidemiology of ZIKV were the outbreaks reported in the Pacific in the Yap Islands, Micronesia, in 2007 and French Polyne-sia in 2013 and 2014, which were followed by pandemic spread of the virus to the Figure 1 (facing page). Emergence and Spread of ZIKV and Timeline of the Zika Virus Pandemic. Panel A shows the major epidemiologic events in the emergence and spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) from its discovery in 1947 through 2018, including outbreaks during which cases of ZIKV-associated birth defects were identified in newborns (*). Panel B is a map of regions where confirmed cases of ZIKV infections have occurred from 2007 through 2018 (red) and areas where Aedes aegypti is endemic but where ZIKV had not yet been identified (pink) as of 2018. Also shown is the migration of African (blue arrow) and Asian (purple arrows) lineages of ZIKV during its global emergence. The epidemiologic events associated with the spread of ZIKV are described in detail in Figure S1 and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.},
