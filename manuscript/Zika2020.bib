Z ika virus (ZIKV) was discovered in Africa in 1947 and was first detected in Asia in 1966, yet its potential effect on public health was not recognized until the virus caused outbreaks in the Pacific from 2007 to 2015 and began spreading throughout the Americas in 2015. 1,2 The ability of ZIKV to cause congenital defects in fetuses and infants, as exemplified by the microcephaly epidemic in Brazil, is an unprecedented feature in a mosquito-borne viral infection. 2-4 Although transmission of ZIKV has declined in the Americas, outbreaks and infection clusters continue to occur in some regions, such as India and Southeast Asia, where there are large populations of women of childbearing age who are susceptible to the virus. 5 We review the body of information that was acquired during the pandemic and discuss the epidemiologic trends, current knowledge about the transmission and natural history of ZIKV infection and its sequelae, and the principles of diagnosis and clinical management. Epidemiol ogic Fe at ur es ZIKV is a positive-sense RNA flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae, which also includes dengue (DENV), West Nile, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. 6 ZIKV was first isolated in 1947 in the Zika Forest in Uganda (Fig. 1), 7 where transmission of the ancestral African lineage of ZIKV was limited to enzootic circulation between nonhuman primates and sylvatic aedes mosquitoes, with sporadic spillover infection to humans. 2 As ZIKV migrated to Asia, the Asian lineage of the virus emerged (Fig. 2), which was capable of being transmitted by human-adapted aedes mosquitoes (e.g., Aedes aegypti). 1,2 Results of serologic and entomologic investigations suggest that ZIKV had an extensive geographic distribution in Africa and Asia before 2007. 1,9 However, fewer than 20 cases in humans were reported before 2007, and all had mild, self-limiting clinical manifestations. 1,2,10 The first indications of a change in the epidemiology of ZIKV were the outbreaks reported in the Pacific in the Yap Islands, Micronesia, in 2007 and French Polyne-sia in 2013 and 2014, which were followed by pandemic spread of the virus to the Figure 1 (facing page). Emergence and Spread of ZIKV and Timeline of the Zika Virus Pandemic. Panel A shows the major epidemiologic events in the emergence and spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) from its discovery in 1947 through 2018, including outbreaks during which cases of ZIKV-associated birth defects were identified in newborns (*). Panel B is a map of regions where confirmed cases of ZIKV infections have occurred from 2007 through 2018 (red) and areas where Aedes aegypti is endemic but where ZIKV had not yet been identified (pink) as of 2018. Also shown is the migration of African (blue arrow) and Asian (purple arrows) lineages of ZIKV during its global emergence. The epidemiologic events associated with the spread of ZIKV are described in detail in Figure S1 and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.},

abstract = {Introduction Epidemic forecasting and prediction tools have the potential to provide actionable information in the midst of emerging epidemics. While numerous predictive studies were published during the 2016–2017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how timely, reproducible, and actionable the information produced by these studies was. Methods To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and grey literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted, or simulated ecological or epidemiological phenomena related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, reproducibility, accessibility, and clarity by independent reviewers. Results 2034 studies were identified, of which n = 73 met the eligibility criteria. Spatial spread, R0 (basic reproductive number), and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} Syndrome burden (4{\%}), sexual transmission risk (4{\%}), and intervention impact (4{\%}). Most studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52{\%}), with few African-specific studies (4{\%}). Case count (67{\%}), vector (41{\%}), and demographic data (37{\%}) were the most common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 7{\%} and 0{\%} of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29{\%} provided all relevant model code, 43{\%} presented uncertainty in all predictions, and 54{\%} provided sufficient methodological detail to allow complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV predictions by a median of 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 30{\%} of studies. Conclusions Many ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016–2017 pandemic. The accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied and indicates there is substantial room for improvement. To enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response it is essential to improve the sharing of model data, code, and preprints for future outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.},

abstract = {Background: In 2016, universal individual donation nucleic acid testing (ID-NAT) of donated blood for Zika virus began in U.S. states and territories. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of universal ID-NAT in the first year of screening compared with alternatives for the 50 states and separately for Puerto Rico. Design: Microsimulation that captured Zika-related harms to transfusion recipients, sexual partners, and their infants. Data Sources: National testing results compiled by AABB and costs, utilities, and outcome probabilities estimated from the literature. Target Population: Transfusion recipients. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal. Intervention: Universal ID-NAT, universal mini-pool NAT (MP-NAT), and ID-NAT exclusively for components transfused to women of childbearing age. Seasonally targeted strategies in Puerto Rico and geographically targeted strategies in the 50 states were also considered. Outcome Measures: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and outcomes. Results of Base-Case Analysis: In Puerto Rico, MP-NAT exclusively during high mosquito season was cost-effective at {\$}81 123 per QALY (95{\%} CI, {\$}49 138 to {\$}978 242 per QALY). No screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states. Universal ID-NAT cost {\$}341 million per QALY (CI, {\$}125 million to {\$}2.90 billion per QALY) compared with no screening in the 50 states. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: In Puerto Rico, MP-NAT only during the season of high mosquito activity was most cost-effective in 64{\%} of probabilistic sensitivity analysis iterations. In the 50 states, no intervention was cost-effective in 99.99{\%} of iterations. Cost-effectiveness was highly dependent on the rate of assumed infectious donations. Limitation: Data were limited on the component-specific trans-missibility of Zika and long-term sequelae of infection. Conclusion: Screening was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico, and no evaluated screening policy was cost-effective in the 50 states. During periods with lower rates of Zika-infectious donations, the cost-effectiveness of screening will be even less favorable. Primary Funding Source: None.},
